This tool box exists of mutliple shell files and two python files, one shows you the entire system information (like neo fetch but without need of aditional programs), one shows your IP like you would if you did IFconfig but asks you which interface (it asks if you are connect through cable or through wifi) and then just shows you the IP of the interface, another just sets the overscan for it :)
